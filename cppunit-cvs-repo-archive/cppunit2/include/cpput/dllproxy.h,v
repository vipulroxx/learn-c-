/*! \brief Manages dynamic libraries.
 *
 * The Dynamic Library Manager provides a platform independent way to work with
 * dynamic library. It load a specific dynamic library, and can returns specific
 * symbol exported by the dynamic library.
 *
 * If an error occurs, a DynamicLibraryManagerException is thrown.
 *
 * \internal Implementation of the OS independent methods is in 
 * DynamicLibraryManager.cpp.
 *
 * \internal Porting to a new platform:
 * - Adds platform detection in config/SelectDllLoader.h. Should define a specific
 *   macro for that platform of the form: CPPUNIT_HAVE_XYZ_DLL_LOADER, where
 *   XYZ is the platform.
 * - Makes a copy of UnixDynamicLibraryManager.cpp and named it after the platform.
 * - Updated the 'guard' in your file (CPPUNIT_HAVE_XYZ_DLL_LOADER) so that it is
 *   only processed if the matching platform has been detected.
 * - Change the implementation of methods doLoadLibrary(), doReleaseLibrary(), 
 *   doFindSymbol() in your copy. Those methods usually maps directly to OS calls.
 * - Adds the file to the project.
