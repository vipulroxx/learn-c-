@What is MSDN Integrator:
-----------------------------------------

MSDN Integrator is a free tool created by Codejock.com software (http://www.codejock.com/)
See the 'free stuff' section of their web site for details.

MSDN Integrator can integrate a HTML HELP documentation with MSDN, and remove it later.

If you have the source release of MSDN Integrator, you can found the documentation
in Doc/MSDNIntegrator.chm.

What was changed:
-------------------------------

I added loading of dialog fields from a .INI file to automatize documentation installation 
(the user don't have to remember the GUID...). 

Version available (sources& binary) at:
http://www.sourceforge.net/projects/cppunit/

See MSDN-CppUnit.INI for an example of .INI file. Pass the file name as a parameter on the 
command line. All file name can be relative to the current directory. Provides a batch file that 
automatically do that for end-user.

User:
--------

Read 'Installing-Doc.txt' for instructions to integrate the documentation with MSDN.

Enjoy,
Baptiste.
