@* bumped version to 1.9.3

* FAQ: added question about 4786 warning on VC++.

* NEWS: updated.

* contrib/msvc/readme.txt: moved to contrib/readme.txt.

* contrib/xml-xsl/report.xsl: added XML style sheet contributed by
'cuppa' project team (http://sourceforge.jp/projects/cuppa/)

* examples/cppunittest/TestResultTest.h:
* examples/cppunittest/TestResultTest.cpp: added tests for
  startTestRun()/endTestRun().

* examples/simple/*: added. A simple example.

* include/cppunit/BriefTestProgressListener.h:
* src/cppunit/BriefTestProgressListener.cpp: added. Verbose progess listener
  that print the test name before running the test.

* include/cppunit/TestListener.h: added startTestRun()/endTestRun().

* include/cppunit/TestResult.h:
* src/cppunit/TestResult.cpp: added runTest(), to be called to run
  a test by test runner.

* src/cppunit/TextTestRunner.cpp:
* src/cppunit/TestRunner.cpp: updated to use TestResult::runTest().

* include/cppunit/plugin/PlugInManager.h:
* src/cppunit/PlugInManager.cpp: added. Managers for all loaded plug-ins.

* include/cppunit/plugin/TestPlugInDefaultImpl.h:
* src/cppunit/TestPlugInDefaultImpl.cpp: renamed TestPlugInAdapter. All
  implementations are empty.

* include/cppunit/plugin/TestPlugInSuite.h: removed.
* src/cppunit/TestPlugInSuite.cpp: removed. Replaced by PlugInManager.

* include/cppunit/plugin/TestPlugIn.h: rewrote the plug-in interface to
  provide more versatility. updated macros to match new interface.

* include/cppunit/extensions/TestFactoryRegistry.h:
* include/cppunit/extensions/TestFactoryRegistry.cpp: Added unregisterFactory().
  Added convenience method addRegistry(). Rewrote registry life cycle
  management. AutoRegisterSuite can now detect that the registry has been
  destroy and not call to it to unregister its test factory.

* include/cppunit/extensions/AutoRegisterTest.h: on destruction, the registered
  factory is unregistered from the registry.

* include/cppunit/extensions/HelperMacros.h: added macros
  CPPUNIT_REGISTRY_ADD_TO_DEFAULT and CPPUNIT_REGISTRY_ADD to help
  build test suite hierarchy.

* src/cppunit/msvc/DllPlugInTester/*: moved to src/cppunit/DllPlugInTester/.

* src/cppunit/DllPlugInTester/DllPlugInTester.cpp: removed UNICODE stuffs. Use
  the PlugInManager instead of PlugInTestSuite. Simplified: only one test on
  command line, but many DLL can be specified. Added configurations to link
  against cppunit dll, those are now the default configuration (static linking
  don't make much sense for plug-in).

building or linking DLL. Defined CPPUNIT_BUILD_DLL when building, and
CPPUNIT_DLL when linking.

* include/cppunit/Portability.h: added empty definition of macro CPPUNIT_API
when not building or using CppUnit as a DLL. When any of those symbol is defined,
the symbol CPPUNIT_NEED_DLL_DECL is set to 1.
