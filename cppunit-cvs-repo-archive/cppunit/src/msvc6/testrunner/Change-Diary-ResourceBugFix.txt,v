@Diary of making test runner DLL resource safe.

Repeat everything, that was done for version 1.8.0. This is point 1) to 9).

0) With the unit-tests for the test runner DLL all four tests fail with the original 
   version 1.9.8 of CPP-Unit.

1) Replace the original integer dialog ids with new string ids
    CPP_UNIT_TEST_RUNNER_IDD_DIALOG_TEST_HIERARCHY
    CPP_UNIT_TEST_RUNNER_IDD_DIALOG_TESTRUNNER
   Because these are not in resource.h VC++ interpretes these values
   as string ids.

2) TestRunnerDlg.cpp:
   - Make a copy of the constructor and replace the integer id with a string id. 
   - Move the initialization code in the two constructors to the new private member 
     function init().
   - Put an ASSERT in the old constructor.
   - Remove the enum IDD=IDD_DIALOG_TESTRUNNER from the resource.h and TestRunnerDlg.h 
     header files. Accordingly remove the default value nDialogResourceId in the
     constructor, that uses the integer id.

3) TreeHierarchyDlg.cpp:
   - Replace the integer id in the call to the base class constructor with
     the new string id.
   - Remove the enum IDD=IDD_DIALOG_TEST_HIERARCHY from the resource.h and 
     TreeHierarchyDlg.h header file.

4) Test. Two of the four tests still fail. The remaining errors result from
   the conflicts in the string table.

5) Since strings ids don't work for the string table I created the new function
   loadCString to load the strings from the correct resource module which is of 
   course the test runner module. The new function is in the files 
   ResourceLoaders.[cpp|h] since I didn't find a good existing place. Baptiste, 
   if you know of a good existing place simply move the function and remove the 
   two new files.

6) Check all occurences of the strings and replace the original string refernces 
   with the new function loadCString.
    IDS_ERROR_SELECT_TEST  
    IDS_ERRORLIST_TYPE     
    IDS_ERRORLIST_NAME     
    IDS_ERRORLIST_FAILED_CONDITION 
    IDS_ERRORLIST_LINE_NUMBER 
    IDS_ERRORLIST_FILE_NAME 

7) Test. No more errors are found.

8) Change the two bitmaps that are used in the list and the tree to use
   string ids instead of integer ids.
   - First changed the unit test so that the originally incorrect behaviour
     is shown. Inserted red circles in the bitmaps in the unit test.
     Then added the new test checkListBitmaps() and changed checkBrowseDlg()
     to let the user visually check, if the correct bitmaps are used.
     This has to be done by the user visually, because I couldn't think of
     an automatic test, that could be implemented easily.
     The last test for the correct bitmaps will ALWAYS fail, so that the
     bitmaps can be checked visually.
   - Changed the RC-file of the test runner DLL:
        CPP_UNIT_TEST_RUNNER_IDB_TEST_TYPE           
        CPP_UNIT_TEST_RUNNER_IDB_ERROR_TYPE     
     Removed the original string ids from resource.h and changed TreeHierarchyDlg.cpp
     and TestRunnerDlg.cpp so that the new string ids are used.


9) Changed the TestPlugInRunner. I don't know, how I can test this and would
   ask you Baptiste to check it or let me know, how I can check it.
   I did the following:
   - Change the dialog id to the string id
        CPP_UNIT_TEST_RUNNER_PLUG_IN_IDD_TEST_PLUG_IN_RUNNER
                             ^^^^^^^ => This is different from the string id used 
                                        in the test runner DLL!
   - Removed the original integer id from resource.h and TestPlugInRunnerDlg.h.
   - Changed the constructor in TestPlugInRunnerDlg.cpp to use the new string id.
   - Replaced the integer id IDR_TEST_PLUGIN_RUNNER for the icon with the string
     id CPP_UNIT_TEST_RUNNER_PLUG_IN_IDR_TEST_PLUGIN_RUNNER in the RC-file and in
     the constructor TestPlugInRunnerDlg and removed the original id from resource.h.


Here start the changes, that were only needed for version 1.9.8.

10) TestRunner is OK now. But I saw, that TestPlugInRunner has now more
   resources than in version 1.8.0. After looking at it more carefully
   it turned out that the sources of the test runner DLL have been 
   included in the test plug-in runner. In version 1.8.0 the test runner
   was used through the testrunner.dll. This means that some additional
   changes have to be made to the test plug-in runner.
   - Additionally changed IDD_DIALOG_TEST_HIERARCHY to 
     CPP_UNIT_TEST_RUNNER_IDD_DIALOG_TEST_HIERARCHY. This is the same
     name as in the original test runner because the dialog is created
     with the original code. I don't know how to check this, thus I'm 
     not sure wether this is OK.
   - Replaced the ids for the bitmaps. Here the same applies as in the 
     previous point, I'm not sure, if it works. 
   - Include ResourceLoaders.cpp in the subproject
        TestPlugInRunner/TestRunner-Was-In-Dll/UserInterface
   - Removed the original #include "TestRunnerApp.h" in ResourceLoaders.cpp
     and replaced it with 
        extern HINSTANCE g_testRunnerResource;
   - Included 
        HINSTANCE g_testRunnerResource;
     in TestPlugInRunnerApp.cpp and set the variable in InitInstance() with 
        g_testRunnerResource = AfxGetResourceHandle();
   - Replaced the integer id for the icon with a string id 
        m_hIcon = AfxGetApp()->LoadIcon("CPP_UNIT_TEST_RUNNER_PLUG_IN_IDR_TEST_PLUGIN_RUNNER");
     in the constructor in TestPlugInRunnerDlg.cpp and in the RC-file.

11) FINISHED.
