@* include/cppunit/Portability.h: moved OStringStream alias definition to
  Portability/Stream.h. User need to define EVC4 to indicate that
  config-evc4.h should be used. (how to we detect this automatically ?).
  Notes that this means it might be needed to add #include <string> to some
  headers since its no longer included by Portability.h.

* include/cppunit/Portability/Stream.h: define alias OStringStream, stdCOut(),
  and OFileStream. If CPPUNIT_NO_STREAM is defined (evc4 config), then provides
  our own implementation (based on sprintf and fwrite).

* include/cppunit/config/config-evc4.h: config file for embedded visual c++ 4.
  Still need to detect for this platform in Portability.h (currently relying on
  EVC4 being defined...)

* *.[cpp/h]: most source files have been impacted with the following change:
  #include <iostream> -> #include <cppunit/Portability/Stream.h>
  std::ostream -> CPPUNIT_NS::OStream
  std::ofstream -> CPPUNIT_NS::OFileStream
  std::cout -> CPPUNIT_NS::stdCOut()
  std::endl -> "\n"
  Also, code using std::cin as been defined out if CPPUNIT_NO_STREAM was defined.
  The exact list of impact files can be obtain in CVS using tags:
  TG_CPPUNIT_NO_STREAM_BEFORE & TG_CPPUNIT_NO_STREAM_AFTER.
