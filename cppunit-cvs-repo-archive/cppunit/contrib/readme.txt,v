msvc/:

	* CppUnit.WWTpl: a template Workspace Whiz! which create a new class 
and add the new files to the project. You can specify that the class is a 
CppUnit testcase and all the macro will be defined to register the test case
and declare the test suite. Workspace Whiz! is an add-ins for VC++. It can
be found at: http://www.workspacewhiz.com/.

* FAQ: added question about 4786 warning on VC++.

* NEWS: updated.

* contrib/msvc/readme.txt: moved to contrib/readme.txt.

* contrib/xml-xsl/report.xsl: added XML style sheet contributed by
'cuppa' project team (http://sourceforge.jp/projects/cuppa/)

* examples/cppunittest/TestResultTest.h:
* examples/cppunittest/TestResultTest.cpp: added tests for
  startTestRun()/endTestRun().

* examples/simple/*: added. A simple example.

* include/cppunit/BriefTestProgressListener.h:
* src/cppunit/BriefTestProgressListener.cpp: added. Verbose progess listener
  that print the test name before running the test.

* include/cppunit/TestListener.h: added startTestRun()/endTestRun().

* include/cppunit/TestResult.h:
* src/cppunit/TestResult.cpp: added runTest(), to be called to run
  a test by test runner.

* src/cppunit/TextTestRunner.cpp:
* src/cppunit/TestRunner.cpp: updated to use TestResult::runTest().

* include/cppunit/plugin/PlugInManager.h:
* src/cppunit/PlugInManager.cpp: added. Managers for all loaded plug-ins.

* include/cppunit/plugin/TestPlugInDefaultImpl.h:
* src/cppunit/TestPlugInDefaultImpl.cpp: renamed TestPlugInAdapter. All
  implementations are empty.

* include/cppunit/plugin/TestPlugInSuite.h: removed.
* src/cppunit/TestPlugInSuite.cpp: removed. Replaced by PlugInManager.

* include/cppunit/plugin/TestPlugIn.h: rewrote the plug-in interface to
  provide more versatility. updated macros to match new interface.

* include/cppunit/extensions/TestFactoryRegistry.h:
* include/cppunit/extensions/TestFactoryRegistry.cpp: Added unregisterFactory().
  Added convenience method addRegistry(). Rewrote registry life cycle
  management. AutoRegisterSuite can now detect that the registry has been
  destroy and not call to it to unregister its test factory.

* include/cppunit/extensions/AutoRegisterTest.h: on destruction, the registered
  factory is unregistered from the registry.

* include/cppunit/extensions/HelperMacros.h: added macros
  CPPUNIT_REGISTRY_ADD_TO_DEFAULT and CPPUNIT_REGISTRY_ADD to help
  build test suite hierarchy.

* src/cppunit/msvc/DllPlugInTester/*: moved to src/cppunit/DllPlugInTester/.

* src/cppunit/DllPlugInTester/DllPlugInTester.cpp: removed UNICODE stuffs. Use
  the PlugInManager instead of PlugInTestSuite. Simplified: only one test on
  command line, but many DLL can be specified. Added configurations to link
  against cppunit dll, those are now the default configuration (static linking
  don't make much sense for plug-in).
