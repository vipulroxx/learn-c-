.SH NAME
cppunit-config \- CppUnit libraries and component information retrieval.
.SH SYNOPSIS
.PP
.B cppunit-config
[\-\-version] [\-\-help] [\-\-cflags] [\-\-libs]
[\-\-prefix] [\-\-exec-prefix] [LIBRARY]...
.SH DESCRIPTION
The \fIcppunit-config\fP program is used to retrieve information from
installed libraries in the system. It is typically used to compile
and link against the CppUnit libraries. Here is a typical usage
scenario in a Makefile:
.PP
.nf
program: program.c
	cc program.c `cppunit-config --cflags --libs cppunit`
.fi
.PP
Usually, a combination of flags is used like --cflags and --libs in
conjunction with the list of libraries that your program uses.  These
libraries are specified as part of the command line.
.SH OPTIONS
The following Generic options are supported:
.TP
.I "--version"
Requests that the CppUnit version information be displayed.
.TP
.I "--help"
Displays a help message and terminates.
.PP
The following options are used to compile and link programs with CppUnit
libraries and components:
.TP
.I "--cflags"
This prints pre-processor and compiler flags required to compile the
module with the libraries specified on the command line.
.TP 
.I "--libs"
This prints the library linking information.  These flags can be
passed to the compiler driver to link an object file with the
libraries specified on the command line.
.PP
The following options are used to find out the directories that were
used to install the files that are part of CppUnit.
They correspond to the variable names used by the
Makefiles (Makefiles in CppUnit are compliant with the GNU standard for
makefiles, and they use GNU autoconf and GNU automake to get
these right and uniform):
.TP
.I "--prefix"
Outputs the prefix that was used to configure the CppUnit libraries.
.TP
.I "--exec-prefix"
Outputs the exec-prefix used to install the CppUnit libraries.
.PP
The basic set of libraries you can link with are:
.nf
   cppunit
.fi
