@		CppUnit --- The C++ Unit Test Library
		-------------------------------------
		    http://cppunit.sourceforge.net


CppUnit is the C++ port of the famous JUnit framework for unit
testing.

For MSWindows installation notes, see INSTALL-WIN32.txt.
For other systems -- including cygwin -- see INSTALL and INSTALL-unix.


Bug reports are welcome.  Please use the SourceForge bug tracking
system at http://sourceforge.net/projects/cppunit/.  Bugs that already
appear in the file BUGS do not need to be reported.

Email to the current maintainers may be sent to
<cppunit-devel@@lists.sourceforge.net>.

		INSTALLATION using configure script
		-----------------------------------
a11 2
See the file INSTALL for basic instructions.  A short explanation for
each non-standard configure option follows.
d13 2
a14 1
  --disable-typeinfo-name 
d16 2
a17 41
Some output from the library will use a class name to distinguish
between tests.  Normally, the Run-Time Type Information system is
used (specifically, the type_info::name() function) to generate
the name.  Some compilers return human-readable names via this
interface.  Other compilers do not.

If your compiler does not generate a pleasing class name, specify
this option; the names will be generated by other means.



		System Notes
		------------

IRIX 6 / MIPSpro compiler 7.30
------------------------------

The MIPSpro compiler requires the "-LANG:std" flag to enable the
standard C++ library.  You must set the CC variable when you configure,
as follows
	./configure CC='CC -LANG:std'

There is a bug in released versions of libtool prevents the -LANG flag
from being properly passed during the linking stage.  To check if you
have this bug, examine the output of "grep 'no.*irix' libtool".  If
you see a line like "no/*-*-irix*)" then you suffer from the bug.  [A
fixed version of libtool will look like "no/*-*-irix* | /*-*-irix*)".]

If your libtool script suffers from the bug, open it in an editor,
find the first line that contains "with_gcc", and change it to
read "with_gcc=no".


DEC alpha with cxx V6.1-029 and RougeWave STL
---------------------------------------------

A user report that you may have to configure using

	./configure DEC_CXX="-D__USE_STD_IOSTREAM -D__STD_MS"

[Is that really "RogueWave"?]

There is a bug in libtool 1.4c (and presumably earlier?) that prevents
this flag from being properly passed during the linking stage.  After
configuring, run "grep with_gcc libtool" in the top of the source
directory.  If the first line of output reads "with_gcc=", then edit
libtool and change it to read "with_gcc=no".

FIXME: the preceeding is unnecessary if we build the release using
a fixed libtool.

this flag from being properly passed during the linking stage.  If you
get error messages about missing standard library functions (e.g. iostream),
then you need to edit the libtool script in the source directory,
find the *first* occurrance of "with_gcc=", and change it to read
"with_gcc=no".
